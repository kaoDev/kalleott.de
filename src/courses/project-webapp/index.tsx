      <p>In this course you will realise your own web application.</p>
      <p>
        It starts with the foundations like the necessary tooling needed for
        coding. And then over the different sessions a react.js based chat-app
        is built to show topics from styling over state-management to functional
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing this course you should be able to build your own
        application running in the browser
      </p>
