              A few years ago I started growing my own chilies and it kind of
              got out of hand. I had too many chilies to eat fresh, so I started
              looking for recipes to get an understanding of the composition of
              hot sauces and started experimenting.
            </p>

              I started giving away bottles to friends and family, if you are
              interested in trying some, let me know!
