  Project WebApp â€” Get firebase to sync your data

Till now the chat app is quite boring, because you
can only talk to yourself. But for synchronization
of the message history with other computers you
need some external service to store the data and
send notifications about changes. Firebase
delivers an all-inclusive solution with a realtime
database capable of syncing datasets to all
connected clients.

The first step to get running is to
[create a new firebase app](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
(or login with a google account). If you are
logged in you should see something like this in
the firebase console:

![firebase console](/images/firebase-console.png)

The "Add project" button opens a wizard with some
questions about your project, select what is
fitting for you (region, data sharing with
google...). After creating the app the only part
missing is the database to enable data storage for
your project click on "GET STARTED" on the
Database tile and on the next screen select
"Realtime Database". For the sake of simplicity
select "start in **test mode**" but be aware to
change the permissions as soon you go public with
your app
([rules documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/)).
Additionally, to the database the chat needs some
kind of authentication to match messages to users.
For the example anonymous authentication is enough
to enable it select "Authentication" in the
firebase app console. Under the "SIGN-IN METHOD"
tab you can select the Anonymous provider and set
it to "enabled".

That's it. Everything else is defined in the app
code.

So next step is to install firebase:

`npm install firebase`

In the firebase console of your app you can get
all config information when you click on "Add
Firebase to your web app". To initialize the app
import `initializeApp` from the package and call
it with the copied config information:

```js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase";

const config = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  authDomain: "AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "STORAGE_BUCKET_URL",
  messagingSenderId: "MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(config);
```

In the chat-app are two collections of data, users
and messages. Each collection with its own rules
how to write and read data.

All database requests begin with the same pattern,
at first you need a reference of the data you want
to work with.

```js
import { database } from "firebase";

database(app).ref(`path/to/the/peace/of/data`);
```

The built up data-reference can get more specified
with some query-functions like
`limitToLast(numberOfEntries)` or
`orderByChild(childKey)`. When the query is fine
you can use different functions to execute it,
`once(event_type)` for is single time data-fetch,
`on(event_type, callback)` for continuous updates,
`set(data)` to update/create the data at the
specified ref-address, `push(data)` to create a
new entry in this collection.

The functions to read and write userData are then
defined as this:

```js
const USERS_REF_NAME = "users";

export async function getUser(userId) {
  return (
    await database(app)
      .ref(`${USERS_REF_NAME}/${userId}`)
      .once("value")
  ).toJSON();
}

export async function writeUserData(
  userId,
  name,
  profilePic
) {
  await database(app)
    .ref(`${USERS_REF_NAME}/${userId}`)
    .set({
      id: userId,
      name,
      profilePic,
    });
}
```

In combination with the anonymous authentication,
every client can create its own user or retrieve
the stored user-data for its own generated id:

```js
export async function getOrCreateAnonymousUser() {
  const anonymous = (
    await auth(app).signInAnonymously()
  ).user;

  let dbUser = await getUser(anonymous.uid);

  if (!dbUser) {
    await writeUserData(anonymous.uid, "", "");
    dbUser = await getUser(anonymous.uid);
  }

  return dbUser;
}
```

To observe changing data is a little more
complicated. Besides providing the callback to
handle update you have to provide some teardown
logic. Like registered event listeners you can
remove a callback by calling
`.off(event_type, callback)` on the data-ref.

Creating an observable from the users collections
then looks like this:

```js
export function usersObservable() {
  return new Observable((observer) => {
    const callback = (dataSnapshot) => {
      const usersJson =
        dataSnapshot.toJSON() || {};

      const userArray = Object.keys(
        usersJson
      ).map((userId) => usersJson[userId]);

      observer.next(userArray);
    };

    // notify observer on value changes
    database(app)
      .ref(USERS_REF_NAME)
      .on("value", callback);
    // return unsubscribe function
    return () => {
      database(app)
        .ref(USERS_REF_NAME)
        .off("value", callback);
    };
  });
}
```

The constructed observable emits a new value
(array of users), each time the collection in the
database changes.

The complete implementation of the chat logic is
available in the
[chat-app-3 repository](https://github.com/kaoDev/chat-app-3).

### Tasks:

- checkout the
  [chat-app-3 repository](https://github.com/kaoDev/chat-app-3)
  (don't forget to npm install)
- get familiar with the Login component
- get familiar with the firebase logic
- extend the users data-model with a last-seen
  flag (update the user every time when there is
  some relevant action in the app)
- show a list of all registered users ordered by
  the time they were last seen
