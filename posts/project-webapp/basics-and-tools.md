The first thing you have to know before you can
develop a successful web application is the
platform you are running on. The "Browser".
Browsers are build to render HTML, a xml-like
language to describe a layout and information.

This image shows a very basic example of HTML
code, which shows a simple hello world message:

![basic html](/images/html-hello-world.png)

rendered it looks like this:

<iframe style="background: white;" srcdoc="<!DocType html><html><body><h1>Hello</h1><p>World</p></body></html>" ></iframe>

It looks ugly, but this is the basis we are
building upon.

To see a more advanced example, just open the dev
tools ( <kbd>F12</kbd>,
<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>âŒ¥</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> ). Besides
a whole lot more content on the site in comparison
to the hello-world example, the most important
differences are two special html tags.

```html
<style />
```

and even more important

```html
<script />
```

with the style-tag it is possible to define css
rules to declare how different elements are
displayed in the browser and the script-tag
enables us to execute JavaScript ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. Having
JavaScript on the page makes it possible to have
interactive elements or even generate new elements
on the site. For example: the following code
snippet inserts a text and an interactive button
in the sample block below this paragraph.

```js
function toggleColor() {
  var element = window.document.querySelector(
    "#toggle-target"
  );

  if (element) {
    element.style.color =
      element.style.color === "black"
        ? "red"
        : "black";
  }
}

var toggleText = document.createElement("div");
toggleText.textContent =
  "By pressing the button you can change the color of this text";
toggleText.id = "toggle-target";
toggleText.style.color = "black";
document
  .querySelector("#sample1")
  .appendChild(toggleText);

var toggleButton = document.createElement(
  "button"
);
toggleButton.textContent = "toggle";
toggleButton.onclick = toggleColor;
document
  .querySelector("#sample1")
  .appendChild(toggleButton);
```

<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 8px;margin: 24px 0;" id="sample1"><b>Sample 1</b></div>

But wait! Generating dynamic pages is an old
story, so what is so great about WebApps?

Running completely in the browser, there is no
need to reload the complete UI after a change in
the dataset. So it can be faster, more responsive
and it can even work offline. Also it is a good
practice of concerns to separate the
data-providers and API-servers from the user
interface.

## Tooling

As you can see in the sample above it can be very
clumsy and unattractive to work with the low-level
browser-apis. Fortunately JavaScript has made a
huge evolutionary jump in the last years and
writing code has become easier. The drawback of
this is the dependency of build-tools.

One of the most important ones is
[babeljs](https://babeljs.io). Babel is a
JavaScript to JavaScript compiler, translating new
fancy features to older standards which all
browsers understand. Another big player is
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It is a build
tool to create bundles of JavaScript containing
only the relevant parts and being executable in
the browser. But as important as those tools are
they are encapsulated in most cases and especially
in the beginning it is not important to know every
detail. Nevertheless you need to be able to run
the tools and because they are all JavaScript
based you need to install
[node.js](https://nodejs.org).

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime based on the
Chrome's V8 engine. For development reasons always
install the current version, the long time support
(LTS) version is relevant if you want to use node
as your server-software. With Node comes also
"npm", the node-package-manger and enormous
JavaScript
[package registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Now you are able to run JavaScript files from your
terminal, but to write those you still need a
development environment. I highly recommend
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
a free and opensource IDE from Microsoft.

To begin the
[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
plugin and the
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
plugin should be enough. ESLint is a tool to mark
potential errors and bad coding patterns, Prettier
is a code formatter for JavaScript, best combined
with "format on save".

If not already known: For every work with code a
versioning system is very important. The industry
standard is [git](https://git-scm.com/) it creates
a version history of all managed files by storing
all changes by line. There is already a git UI
integrated in VS Code, but another good (free for
non commercial use) graphical git client is
[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). To store
your project online as an open-source project
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the place to be.

### Tasks:

- set up a JavaScript node project with the npm
  init command
- initialize git versioning for the project
  (choose a good
  [.gitignore template](https://github.com/github/gitignore))
- use the
  [chalk package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)
  to print something in a random color to the
  terminal
