Whenever someone talks about the internet of
things the cloud is not far. And just as the real
thing the cloud in this context has no clear
outline. It's one of the buzzwords carrying the
heavy burden of being suitable for marketing.

I personally like the definition of of the cloud
as a way to hand over the responsibility to manage
own servers or services to another entity. It
ranges from managed machines, where you still have
to care about everything above the operating
system, to ready to use pieces of software like
[cloudmqtt](https://www.cloudmqtt.com). In modern
software development the managed machines are
loosing relevance and managed platforms capable of
running individual software packed in standardized
containers like [Docker](https://docker.com) are
getting more important. Besides containerization
many platform providers also have a way to just
upload the code and decide on the project
structure what to run. For example a node program
has a `package.json` file describing all
dependencies and there are convention based
default "scripts" listed like `build`, `test` and
`start`.

If you don't have some really extreme requirements
you can freely choose from almost every provider
on the market. There are of course the big
software companies like Amazon, Microsoft and
Google with their cloud platforms but for small
projects or experimentation a really good and also
free alternative is [heroku](https://heroku.com).
On the
[devcenter.heroku.com/](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)
site there are a lot of tutorials explaining how
to run and deploy software written in different
languages. Here I will concentrate on the node.js
platform and how to transfer the mqtt data server
from last session into the cloud. So this will be
a short summary of the heroku
[deploying-nodejs-tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs).

## Running Node.js on Heroku

### Prerequisites

- An Heroku account
  [signup.heroku.com](https://signup.heroku.com)
- The Heroku CLI
  [cli.heroku.com/](https://cli.heroku.com/)
- git
  [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  (here is a short
  [guide to the git fundamentals](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/))

As you might already have thought by the
mentioning of git the deployment of a Node.js app
to Heroku is based on the versioning tool. So the
first step should be to prepare your project to
work well with git. The most important part here
is to tell git which files should be ignored and
don't have to be tracked (mainly the node_modules
folder). To do so just add a file called
`.gitignore` to your project folder, and list all
files and folders you want to ignore:

```gitignore
# Dependency directories
node_modules/
jspm_packages/

# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# =========================
# Operating System Files
# =========================

# OSX
# =========================

.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride

# Thumbnails
._*

# Files that might appear on external disk
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes

# Directories potentially created on remote AFP share
.AppleDB
.AppleDesktop
Network Trash Folder
Temporary Items
.apdisk

# Windows
# =========================

# Windows image file caches
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db

# Folder config file
Desktop.ini

# Recycle Bin used on file shares
$RECYCLE.BIN/

# Windows Installer files
*.cab
*.msi
*.msm
*.msp

# Windows shortcuts
*.lnk
```

After the preparation for git you can initialize a
git repository inside this folder with the
`git init` command. With the `git add *` command
all files with a change are "staged", the
`git commit -m "Commit message"` finally adds the
changes to the version history of the repository.
Although it is important to know those
fundamentals and basic git commands it is a lot
easier to use with a graphical user interface,
like the one embedded in visual studio code.

The next step is important for Heroku to digest
your project. The used dependencies are already
listed in the package.json and will be installed
automatically:

```json
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "mqtt": "^2.18.8",
    "micro": "^9.3.3",
    "ip": "^1.1.5"
  }
  ...
```

Now it is important to tell Heroku how to start
the server application, that's done by adding the
"start" script, which should already be present in
the mqtt project from the "micro" package which
uses the main file from the project to start a
microservice, but the command needs the parameter
to know on which port to listen:

```json
  ...
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "micro -l tcp://0.0.0.0:$PORT"
  },
  ...
```

As the last step tell Heroku what version of
Node.js to use:

```json
...
  "engines": {
    "node": "11.x"
  },
...
```

Now with all this information it's time to work
with heroku itself. Use the command `heroku login`
to authenticate with your personal account. To
create a new app you can either use the
web-interface
[dashboard.heroku.com/new-app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app)
or the cli with the command `heroku create`. The
CLI command automatically links the remote git
repository used for deployment. If you used the
web-interface you still have to link it by using
the `heroku git:remote -a HEROKU_APP_NAME`
command.

Before you start committing all changes to your
git repository you have to make sure to remove all
account information from your code. Once it is
under version control it is hard to get rid of the
publicly available information. A good way to do
so is replacing the hard coded values with
references to environment variables. On Node.js
you can access the environment through
`process.env.YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME`.

You can edit the environment variables for your
heroku app in the web interface.

Now you can deploy your application to a server
managed by Heroku with just one command:

```shell
git push heroku master
```

### Tasks

- replace any account information in your code
  with environment variables
- prepare your mqtt-server project folder for git
  and heroku
- create a new heroku app
- run your application on heroku
