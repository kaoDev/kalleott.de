After bringing the software to the cloud last
week, this session is all about the next buzzword:
Serverless.

Like the "cloud", "serverless" is also a very
vague definition and to make it clear from the
start, yes there are running servers to run your
serverless code. The term serverless describes
more the way the services you develop are written,
it's one more step on the abstraction layer. I see
two ways to do serverless development, the first
is based on SaaS products and basically plug and
play of different tools. The second one is
referenced as functions running in the cloud,
which is more of an architecture decision than a
new cloud technology. For larger projects these
principles enable you to have a very granular and
precise encapsulation of responsibility. For
smaller projects serverless development enables
you to get running really fast, because you don't
have to care about any platform or infrastructure.
On the other hand giving away all these decisions
also strips away flexibility, so always think
carefully about your needs before you set down on
one tech-stack.

For this course and our sensor project we will use
[firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), a
service by google, which also has a generous free
plan. After authenticating with your google
account you can open the
[firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
to manage your projects.

When you add a new project to your firebase
account you can decide on some privacy and
location settings for your service. But to host
some functions, at the moment only the us
locations are viable.

With firebase you get an all in one service
providing solutions for authentication, database,
storage, hosting, functions and even machine
learning capabilities. For the sensors project
only collects data from the connected sensors so
the first migration step from the still
file-system based storage solution on heroku is to
create a database for your firebase project. To do
so select the "Database" section and create a new
firestore database (if you aren't sure what you
are doing start in locked mode).

To use this database you need the
[firebase-admin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-admin)
dependency. And you should create a new service
account by going to google
[cloud admin area](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
of your project. The new service account should
have the editor role to be able to write data. On
the last step create a json key file which will be
used to authenticate to the database from the node
process. Save the json file to the project folder
and add it to a `.gitignore` file to prevent
adding it to a repository.

Before you start working on the actual program you
should start by creating the new project on the
Raspberry Pi:

```json
{
  "name": "firebase-device",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "node-dht-sensor": "^0.0.34",
    "onoff": "^3.2.2",
    "sleep-promise": "^8.0.1",
    "yargs": "^12.0.5",
    "firebase-admin": "^6.3.0"
  }
}
```

Unfortunately right now the protocol
([gRPC](https://grpc.io/)) to transfer data to and
from firebase is not directly compatible with
Node.js on ARMv6 and has to be built on the
device. After running `npm install` in the project
folder run the command

```bash
npm rebuild --build-from-source grpc
```

The rebuild process takes some time (especially on
the Raspberry Pi) so I have prepared a zipped
`node_modules` folder with the installed and
rebuild dependencies for node `v10.14.1` and
`v11.1.0`

##### [node_modules-node10-grpc-armv6.tar.gz](https://github.com/kaoDev/kalleott.de/raw/prebuilt_archives/samples/firebase-device/node_modules-node10-grpc-armv6.tar.gz)

```bash
curl -o node_modules-node10-grpc-armv6.tar.gz https://github.com/kaoDev/kalleott.de/raw/prebuilt_archives/samples/firebase-device/node_modules-node10-grpc-armv6.tar.gz
tar -zvxf node_modules-node10-grpc-armv6.tar.gz -C ./
```

##### [node_modules-node11-grpc-armv6.tar.gz](https://github.com/kaoDev/kalleott.de/raw/prebuilt_archives/samples/firebase-device/node_modules-node11-grpc-armv6.tar.gz)

```bash
curl -o node_modules-node11-grpc-armv6.tar.gz https://github.com/kaoDev/kalleott.de/raw/prebuilt_archives/samples/firebase-device/node_modules-node11-grpc-armv6.tar.gz
tar -zvxf node_modules-node11-grpc-armv6.tar.gz -C ./
```

Now that all dependencies are able to run on the
device you can start to setup the connection to
the "Firestore" database.

```js
// load the firebase dependency
const firebase = require("firebase-admin");

// load the certificate data created in
// https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
// the account needs write access
const serviceAccount = require("./firebase-key.json");

// initialize firebase app with authentication data
firebase.initializeApp({
  credential: firebase.credential.cert(
    serviceAccount
  ),
});

// get the reference to the firebase database
const db = firebase.firestore();
// set timestampsInSnapshots in the settings
// (needed to prevent some legacy warnings)
db.settings({
  timestampsInSnapshots: true,
});
```

Writing data with firestore is pretty straight
forward, you just choose a collection to write to
and then either add or set the data:

```js
/**
 * takes the sensor values for temperature and humidity and the name
 * of the source sensor
 *
 * @param {number} temperature
 * @param {number} humidity
 * @param {string} name
 */
async function writeData(
  temperature,
  humidity,
  name
) {
  try {
    await db.collection("sensorData").add({
      temperature,
      humidity,
      name,
      // let the database create a timestamp
      date: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(
      "error writing to firestore",
      e
    );
  }
}
```

In the firebase console you can now see data added
live to your database:

### Tasks

- create a firebase app to manage your sensor data
- extend the program running on the Raspberry Pi
  to write data to the Firestore
