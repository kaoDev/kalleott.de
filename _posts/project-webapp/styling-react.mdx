  "Learn how to style React components using various approaches, including
  inline styles, styled-components, glamorous, and emotion. This guide explains
  each method's benefits and provides practical examples to help you implement
  component-based styling efficiently in your React applications."

The classic approach to styling in the browser is creating a CSS file and
provide it with a `<link />` tag. The tutorial from last session also worked
with an external CSS file, but linked it by adding a JS `import` statement. The
benefits of this way are an easy separation of concerns and the already known
workflow of styling HTML elements.

But the separation of concerns also leads to another path. In react an
application is separated into components, but the workflow of defining global
style-classes is quite contrary. So why not rethink it?

[Christiano Rastelli](https://twitter.com/areaweb) made this wonderful graphic,
which shows a new way of drawing boundaries in a component oriented application
architecture.

By separating the architecture in this way, a component becomes responsible for
its behavior (JS), layout (HTML) and design (CSS). All these concerns should
only be influenced by the component itself.

One viable solution is to use normal CSS rules with unique style rules for every
component. For very small projects this approach is well suited but as soon as a
project becomes a bit larger and the component count rises it gets harder and
harder to name the CSS rules in its global namespace. To eliminate this downside
of CSS the simplest solution is to just use inline styling.

```jsx
const Title = (props) => (
  <h1
    style={{
      fontSize: "1.5em",
      textAlign: "center",
      color: "forestgreen",
    }}
    {...props}
  />
);
```

It is simple, but some important features are missing (for example media-queries
and keyframe animations) and it's not as performant as css-class-rules.

The solution: Take the best from both worlds!

Write the style rules in JavaScript, but generate class-rules. The most commonly
used library to support this workflow is
[styled-components ðŸ’…](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components),
which enables you to define components, only containing information about the
element type and styling. Those are very well suited as the basic building
blocks of any web app. To work with, the styled component lib provides a
[tagged template literals](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals)
factory for each HTML base element.

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: forestgreen;
`;
```

It's even possible to generate style depending on the component props by
inserting functions into the template string.

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: forestgreen;

  ${(props) =>
    props.primary &&
    css`
      background: forestgreen;
      color: white;
    `};
`;
```

This string based generation of styles has the benefit of common syntax, if you
know CSS. But in comparison to writing simple objects it can get cumbersome if
you are working with many variables.

Like always in the JavaScript world, if there is a problem, there will be a lib.
For this case [glamorous ðŸ’„](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous) delivers. It
has an API quite similar to styled-components but instead of working with
template-strings you define the styles like the react inline styles as objects.
For more complex scenarios the component generator function can take multiple
arguments, either a style object or a function returning a style object.

```jsx
import glamorous from "glamorous";

const Title = glamorous.h1(
  {
    fontSize: "1.5em",
    textAlign: "center",
    color: "forestgreen",
  },
  (props) =>
    props.primary && {
      background: "forestgreen",
      color: "white",
    },
);
```

Last but not least [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) should be
mentioned. This lib enables you to work with both template-strings and objects.

```jsx
import styled from "react-emotion";

const Title = styled("h1")`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? "white" : "forestgreen")} forestgreen;
  background: ${(props) => (props.primary ? "forestgreen" : "unset")};
`;
```

```jsx
import styled from "react-emotion";

const Title = styled("h1")(
  {
    fontSize: "1.5em",
    textAlign: "center",
    color: "forestgreen",
  },
  (props) =>
    props.primary && {
      background: "forestgreen",
      color: "white",
    },
);
```

### Tasks

- clone the [chat-app-start](https://github.com/kaoDev/chat-app-start)
  repository and start the dev-server (`npm start`)
- choose one of the styling approaches
  [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation),
  [glamorous](https://glamorous.rocks/),
  [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/install) and install needed dependencies
- start styling the `User` and `Message` components, you can find some
  inspiration on [dribble](https://dribbble.com/search?q=chat+ui) or
  [google images](https://www.google.de/search?q=chat+ui+example&tbm=isch)
