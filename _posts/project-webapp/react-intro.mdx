To use react we need two packages from npm,
[react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) itself and
[react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom). React takes care of
managing a virtual DOM representation and is highly optimized to handle state
updates and changes in the virtual DOM tree following the state change. The
second part "react-dom" is responsible for bringing the virtual representation
of the DOM to the browser and also provides wrapped APIs for browser based stuff
like event-handlers on elements.

Because every new beginning starts with a hello-world, here it is in react:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
```

As you can see there is some HTML-like syntax mixed right into the
JavaScript-Code, this
[language extension is called JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#jsx).
This extended syntax enables you to write shorter and more readable code, but it
must be transpiled to real JavaScript before it can be executed in a browser.

The hello-world as transpiled code looks like this:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!"),
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

So every JSX-Tag gets replaced with a call to
`React.createElement(tag, props, children)`. That's already a nice to have
feature, but JSX starts to shine when you define your own UI components and can
use them as new JSX-tags. Components can either be classes extending the
React.Component class, or simple functions returning valid JSX elements. There
is only one convention based rule, the name of the Component either class or
function must start with a capital letter, because all JSX-tags starting with a
lowercase letter are interpreted as native browser elements. Now a hello-world
with a self defined component:

```jsx
const HelloWorld = () => <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById("rooot"));
```

-->

```js
var HelloWorld = function HelloWorld() {
  return React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!");
};
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(HelloWorld, null),
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

For a better understanding of the JSX syntax and its corresponding JavaScript
code the
[babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&browsers=&build=&builtIns=false&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBAEgUwDZJAdRAJyQExgXhgAoBKAgPhgB4ALARnMRRABoYB3LXAQioHp65ANwAoAEoIAhsCgARAPIBZAHSYEYHAkxERMak1QZsePuRa6YOEMACuAW3VRlAcwRQAokgQOwUAEIAngCSOEQARJggIFBhJOYkQkA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&lineWrap=true&presets=react%2Cstage-2%2Cenv&prettier=false&targets=&version=6.26.0&envVersion=1.6.2)
is a great tool tp play with.

The `HelloWorld` component didn't have any parameters but as part as you can see
in the `React.createElement`, there is second parameter `null`. If you want to
provide some information to a component you can define and use the properties
like this:

```jsx
const HelloName = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(<HelloName name={"Peter"} />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

-->

```js
var HelloName = function HelloName(props) {
  return React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, ", props.name, "!");
};
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(HelloName, {
    name: "Peter",
  }),
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

The same component defined as a Component-class looks like this:

```jsx
class HelloName extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { name } = this.props;
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<HelloName name={"Peter"} />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

But Component-classes are only necessary if you have to manage some state inside
of the component, and even this can be done with components providing
state-management functions.

The last important bit of information about the JSX syntax is the `children`
property. With `children` you get access to the information given to you between
the opening and closing tag of your component. So you could redefine the
`HelloName` component like this:

```jsx
const HelloName = ({ children }) => <h1>Hello, {children}!</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(<HelloName>Peter</HelloName>, document.getElementById("root"));
// behaves the same as
ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloName children={"Peter"} />,
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

But with children you provide other JSX-elements so you could also write:

<component-playground
complex="true" sample="HelloName.js" ></component-playground>

So that's it, now you know the most important things about JSX and can start to
use react.

### Tasks

- work through the very fine
  [react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
- when finished with the tic-tac-toe game change the css rules to use flex-box
  and check if the react-layout code can be simplified
