If you dig a bit deeper into the react-dom package you will find a sub folder
called server and there is a function `renderToString`. As the name suggests it
will return an HTML string instead of creating DOM-elements in the browser, this
string can then be sent as a result of a client request.

The hello-world example with [micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) and
[babel-node](https://new.babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-node.html):

```jsx
import micro from "micro";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOMServer from "react-dom/server";

const server = micro(async (req, res) => {
  return ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<h1>Hello world!</h1>);
});

server.listen(3000);
```

This server sends an `h1` tag with the text "Hello world!" as a response to each
request. A real world application would collect some data from a database or
other sources and inject it as props into the react app to populate the
generated markup with relevant content. A little more complex but still very
basic example to play with can be cloned from
[here](https://github.com/kaoDev/react-minimal-ssr).

But because there are many pitfalls like state management, content compression,
routing and many many other complicate problems when rendering a webapp on the
server you should take some libraries for help.

One simple and powerful framework is [next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It runs as
a node server and allows you to have complex logic on the server and interactive
react features at the same time. Here is a nice
[video by Guillermo Rauch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evaMpdSiZKk)
presenting the framework on React Conf 2017.

Another way to create a website is working with the
[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/). JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs and Markup.
That means split you project into a server that has an API but doesn't render
any UI and a frontend consisting of HTML files linking to script files. So
everything not dynamic (depending on API calls) can be pre-rendered to static
files which can be distributed to the users via an CDN. One of the go-to
solutions for generating static files from a react project is
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Like next.js it provides many useful
abstractions to handle many of the common pitfalls. It has also a growing
collection of [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and
[starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/) which provide even
more magic.

As a first example to play with I can provide this page itself it is based on
the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and
the code is [hosted on github](https://github.com/kaoDev/project-webapp). As
it's data-source to generate pages for each blog post it uses markdown files,
which are read on build time and then provided to the react components through a
graphql API.

One of the easiest hosting solutions for a gatsby page is
[netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). You just connect your git repository
containing the code of the page and on every push to master a new build is
created and published. With [netlify cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/) there
even exists a CMS solution with an user friendly interface to write content.

### Taks

- Choose a [gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/) and
  start your own static site
- publish the site on
  [GitHub](https://github.com)/[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)/[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.com)
  and then to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
