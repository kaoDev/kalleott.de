After collecting data the next step is to use this information. And one of the
best ways to do so is paint beautiful graphs based on the numbers. There are
many tools to support you like [kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)
or [grafana](https://grafana.com/) which are both open source software and
capable to display large amounts of data coming from live streams. If you want
to get your hands a bit dirty you can also go for one of the bazillion
javascript frameworks. Both ways have benefits and drawbacks, for larger
projects with possibly huge datasets, kibana and co. are the way to go. Those
tools come with query languages to generate graphs from data stores like elastic
search, are battle tested in big data environments and basically industry
standard, so support and general knowledgebase is great. The drawbacks are a
more complicated setup and hosting than a browser based javascript solution. In
principle, with each solution path you have to decide what data you want to
display and how you want to display it.

For this project or comparably sized ones I recommend setting up a custom
visualization with javascript to save the effort of hosting another data storing
solution and a dedicated visualization service. If you already have a complete
kibana/grafana or comparable setup this is another story, then you should just
add your project to the existing setup. If not the hosting of a static web app
is pretty easy, even firebase has a hosting solution included.

So the first step is to install the firebase-tools as a global package to
control your firebase projects from the terminal.

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Then use `create-react-app` to bootstrap a new react based web application. Run
the following command to create a new folder (APP_NAME) containing the code for
the application:

```bash
npx create-react-app APP_NAME
```

When the initialization process is complete you can start a development server
to start working on the web app with the command `npm start` run in the project
folder. With the command `npm run build` you can create an optimized build to
serve over the internet.

To publish the web site to firebase start by signing in with the command
`firebase login` and continue with `firebase init`. During the init process you
have to make some choices:

- **Which Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this folder?**: Hosting
- **What do you want to use as your public directory?** build
- **Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?** yes

With firebase initialized you can now run `firebase deploy` to publish your
application, remember to run `npm run build` to have a freshly built version in
the build folder.

When you got familiar with the basic project setup you need to install two more
dependencies: `[@firebase/app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)` and
`[recharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts)`. The firebase package let's
you connect to firebase and access your data, the recharts package provides
composable react-components to build up charts and graphs.

```bash
npm install firebase recharts
```

To connect to your firestore instance start by initializing the firebase app and
then get the reference to the firestore:

```js
import app from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/firestore";

const config = {
  apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY,
  databaseURL: YOUR_DATABASE_DOMAIN,
  projectId: YOUR_PROJECT_ID,
};

const firebaseApp = app.initializeApp(config);

const firestore = firebaseApp.firestore();
const settings = { timestampsInSnapshots: true };
firestore.settings(settings);
```

With the working firestore reference you can now query data by using the
firestore API:

```js
function subscribeToSensorData(onUpdate) {
  return firestore
    .collection("sensorData") // choose the collection of your data
    .orderBy("date", "desc") // order the saved documents by date descending
    .limit(40) // only take the last 40 entries
    .onSnapshot((snapshotData) => {
      onUpdate(
        // on an update deliver the data to the callback
        // transform the snapshot data to the actual objects
        snapshotData.docs.map((documentSnapshot) => {
          const data = documentSnapshot.data();

          return {
            ...data,
            date: new Date(data.date.seconds * 1000),
          };
        }),
      );
    });
}
```

But when you call this function and try to read data you will get this error:

![error message of firestore, notifying that there are permissions missing to read](/images/iot/firebase-auth-error.png)

This means that you have to configure the rules of the database so that reads
are allowed. To change the rules go to the database settings in the firebase
console and choose the rules tab. The following ruleset will allow all reads and
deny writes without admin access.

![database rules with public read- and private write-access](/images/iot/firebase-database-rules.png)

Now after allowing reads, the next step is to connect the firebase data with the
actual app. A React component extending the `Component` class can hold an
instance state object which will trigger a re-render whenever it gets updated by
the `setState` method of the component. So this state is ideal to hold the graph
data. To subscribe to the firestore updates and save the result in the instance
state extend the `App` as follows:

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  // initial state with an empty data array
  state = { sensorData: [] }

  // method that gets called when this component
  // instance got inserted into the view
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = subscribeToSensorData(this.onSensorData)
  }

  // method that gets called when this component
  // instance will be removed
  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe()
    }
  }

  // method to store the given data in the component state
  onSensorData = sensorData => {
    this.setState({ sensorData })
  }

  render() {...}

}
```

The `App` component now has access to the stored sensorData and finally you can
start to render a chart with it. The library Recharts provides a lot of
functionality and you should definitely have a look into the documentation
[recharts.org](http://recharts.org/en-US)

Here is an example of a line-chart displaying the temperature over the date:

```jsx
...
  render() {
    return (
      <LineChart width={500} height={300} data={this.state.sensorData}>
        <XAxis dataKey="date" />
        <YAxis
          orientation="left"
          type="number"
          yAxisId="temperature"
          domain={[-50, 50]}
        />
        <Line
          dot={false}
          type="monotone"
          dataKey="temperature"
          yAxisId="temperature"
          stroke="#ee2142"
        />
        <Legend
          content={
            <div>
              <div style={{ color: '#ee2142' }}>Temperature in °C</div>
            </div>
          }
        />
      </LineChart>
    )
  }
...
```

### Tasks

- choose fitting charts to display the temperature and humidity values
- deploy your chart(s) to firebase
